# AI-Regulatory-Compliance-Checker

AI-Regulatory-Compliance-Checker is an advanced AI-powered system that automates contract review and ensures compliance with major regulatory frameworks such as GDPR and HIPAA. Using powerful LLMs like **OpenAI GPT**, **Meta LLaMA**, and **LangChain**, the system detects missing clauses, identifies risks, and provides context-aware recommendations based on the latest regulatory updates and industry standards.

The tool integrates data from **Google Sheets**, **public websites**, and **emails** to deliver real-time compliance checks, automated notifications, and continuous contract monitoring—reducing manual workload and minimizing compliance risks.

## 🔧 How It Works (High-Level)

1. User uploads a contract document (PDF/DOCX/text).  
2. AI extracts clauses and identifies gaps.  
3. Compliance engine cross-checks GDPR/HIPAA requirements.  
4. LLM generates improvement recommendations.  
5. Dashboard shows compliance score and risks.  
6. Continuous monitoring updates contracts when regulations change.
